                <p style="text-align: end;">
                  I was born in Fresno, California in 1990. I lived for a few years in the Sacramento area in a neighborhood where school, church, and home were all in walking distance. I grew up in a house with both parents, religiously charismatic protestant, and in public school, made and lost freinds over the years, etc.. My family moved back to Fresno to be closer to family on both sides.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                  Living in Fresno near Roosevelt Highschool/Huntington I went to small elementry called Jackson. From there I was accepted into the magnet program in our school system and so I went to Compu-Tech Middle School and then onto to Edison High School where both schools were kind of known as bad side of town. There were some hardshipos along the way into adulthood. And little by little I felt prepared to deal with something later on that would be very difficult to bare.
                  After highschool I went straight to community college and studied my passion which is music. I loved jazz and that'ss what I wanted to play more than anything. OLpportunities came and went and I always kept my head up. Both because of my religious experience I learned how to be independant and to deal with the great pains of life while also having the love and support of family and friends which continued past my early 20's.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                  By the year of my injury in September, 2019 my adulthood life was full of business and happiness. I had a small group of friends who by this point were all family metaphorically and in some cases literally. Work-life was there to make ends meet. I had a mentor for my music pursuits who saw me get on the local radio and TV before streaming content could make someone famous. i stayed current in my religious practices. Due to a few scares in my life including being robbed way back in highschool, knives being pulled on me, my work expreince as a security gaurd I determined that I should be trained to defend myself. I never went miltary but I recieved trained in Self-defense which included solid firearm training and military style-grappling to some extent. I support 2A excersizing of rights.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                  The fatal day that changed my life I couldn't have been caught more prepared or unaware. At the time a was very serious about rideshare services and had made it my main source of income. I was also communting to San Jose and had just secured a new job which meant I would be a commuter and on the road alot. That being said work is work and I could have been more exhausted one night on September 14, 2019. After finshing a shift on the LYFT rideshare platform tired I pulled over turned my car off and fell asleep barely managing to inform family where I was. I was woken up at gunpoint. I was told i was being robbed. i was coerced out of my car at gun point and in the course of attempting to defend myself. I was shot in back and my body below my waist immediately fell to the ground. I remained deligent however a allowed the training I had to kick in. I didn't give up. I had now experienced my first and hopefully my only firefight in my life.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: right;">
                  I have found peace and comfort despite very phisycial limitations and frustrations that come up everyday. The things in my life that have happened I feel bare no coincidence as every hardship or challeneg met helped shape me to bare the drastic changes of becoming paralized with an incomplete T11 Spinal Cord injury from a gunshot. i've begun rebuidling my life and haven't trying to be independant.
